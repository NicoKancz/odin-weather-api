# Weather API

## Weather Showcase
This app does what it says: simply showcasing weather data of a city of your choice in text. <br>
To fetch weather data type in the city name of your choice into the search input field. <br>
You can then click on one of the days so more detailed information can show up.

## Purpose
I build this application as an exercise for myself, the task and purpose was to learn about Fetch API with JavaScript. <br>
Task was given by a website called "The Odin Project", here the link: <br> https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-weather-app. <br>
<br>
It's like a roadmap, lessons with many articles and exercises of fullstack web development. <br>
It is written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript respectively.
